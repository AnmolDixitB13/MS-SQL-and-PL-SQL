-- Write a program in SQL to perform banking operations - create a new account, update an account,
-- delete an account and read/fetch details such as balance of an account. All these operations as 
-- mentioned should be written as a procedure. Use option no. to select which action has to be 
-- performed among the options/tasks listed above, eg 1 will be for debitting an account, 2 will be 
-- crediting money into an account... and so on. If the user enters wrong option no, it should display
-- invalid option no.
--
-- Include triggers which will be triggered when 
-- 1. an account is created
-- 2. an account is debited
-- 3. an account is credited
-- 4. an account is updated
-- 5. an account is deleted
--
--
-- Include 2 tables in this code: 
-- 1. AccountsRecord which stores the account details such as acc. holder's name, opening balance,
-- credit, debit amounts, final balance along with account no, which is the primary key.
-- 2. TransactionList - every time a transaction like debiting or crediting of an account, updation
-- and/or deletion of an account occurs, it will be stored in this table, via suitable triggers. Acc. 
-- no. of the previous table will act as foreign key in this table.
-- 
-- Whenever bank procedure is called to perform operation like debit/credit/update/read/delete an 
-- account, 1st verify whether the option no. entered is valid or not, then find whether the account
-- no. provided is in AccountsRecord or not i.e. account exist or not. If the account exists, then
-- verify that the name provided matches the name present in the AccountsRecord table at that account
-- no. If yes, then proceed to execute the task via the procedure.
